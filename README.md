[Demonstration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84742628/128653290-962aaf14-ff95-4f5e-856b-df0f6f955ad6.mp4)

## Description

This application was built with Javascript and Node.js and is designed to allow users to create a README file from the command line without having to design it from scratch. The application primarily uses the Inquirer module to generate prompts for the user in order to create the content of the file.

## Usage

Upon starting the application, the user sees a number of prompts to determine what the content of the file should be, and then that user input is applied to the structure of the file which is already in place. There are sections for the title of the project, description, installation, usage, licensing information, contributions, and testing. A table of contents as well as a link to the user's GitHub profile is also included.
